<h1>Social Model Description - Round 2</h1>
    
<p>You are a member of the society of {{group_size}} individuals where everyone is engaged in 4 types of activities:</p>
<table>
    <tr>
        <td><b>Paid complex work</b>
            <br>Multiplication within one hundred ({{wage_high}}‚Ç¨/month)</td>
        <td><b>Paid simple work</b> 
            <br>Addition within ten ({{wage_low}}‚Ç¨/month)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>Unpaid work</b>
            <br> Choices of 2 scenarios for unpaid work in reality
        </td>
        <td><b>Not working</b>
            <br>Enjoy a landscape photo
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>If you make a mistake in maths tasks, you will receive only a <b>half of wage</b>. You can decide your work choice for each of 12 months per year (h = completed tasks).</p>

<p>In this round of the game, there will be <b>progressive tax scheme</b>, that will be applied to the wages of the {{number_of_questions_per_stage}} tasks.</p>

<p>The gross income I, payoff ùúã, and income tax T from the first round of the game will be presented after completing {{number_of_questions_1_stage}} tasks.</p>

<p>Note: Taxed are only applied on the part where <b>payoff exceeds</b> {{cutoff_income_low}} ‚Ç¨ ({{cutoff_income_low}} ‚Ç¨ is the tax threshold), which is approximately equal to choosing 7 simple work tasks in this round of the game.</p>

<p>In addition to your wage from paid work the state gives you a {{(subsidy_rate_WS * 100)|int}}% subsidy (s) each time when you choose paid work.</p>
